  out.width = "90%"
)
#set the figure width to be six everywhere and the aspect ratio to be 0.6. And this out width means that it's going to take up 90% of the width of like an html document or a word document.

## Same plot from last time

```{r}
weather_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax, color = name)) + geom_point(alpha=0.5)+ labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Min daily temp (Degrees C)",
    y ="Min daily temp",
    color = "Location",
    caption = "Max vs. min daily temp in three locations; data from rnoaa"
)
  
# do the label: labs function to x,y and color
#adding message below the x: caption function
#adding title: title function
```

```{r}
weather_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax, color = name)) + geom_point(alpha=0.5)+ labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Min daily temp (Degrees C)",
    y ="Min daily temp",
    color = "Location",
    caption = "Max vs. min daily temp in three locations; data from rnoaa"
)+
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(-15,0,15),
    labels=c("-15 C", "0", "15")
  )+
  scale_y_continuous(
    position = "right",
    trans = "sqrt"
  )

#scale:try to modify whatever the default mapping between a variable and the aesthetic that it's mapped onto sort of how those behave

#breaks: where you want to break as exist

#position: move to the place you want (right/left)

#trans function: transfer the numbers to what types of format, like sqrt

#limit function: limit the range you want or you can filter the range by using filter to limit the range value of variables
#like:   filter(tmax >=20, tmax <=30)
```


what about colors...



```{r}
weather_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax, color = name)) + geom_point(alpha=0.5)+ labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Min daily temp (Degrees C)",
    y ="Min daily temp",
    color = "Location",
    caption = "Max vs. min daily temp in three") + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
 # use viridis color package 
```
